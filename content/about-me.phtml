<p>This page is supposed to be about me so here we go. Born 1998. Graduated High School in 2016. Computer science education
major. Supposed to graduate in Fall 2020. I plan on teaching in Muscogee County until I can move out with my girlfriend.
That's about it. Here's the profile picture I use for everything because it is so ridiculous. </p>
